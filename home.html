        <h1 class="fade-text">The Clone by Alloramomo</h1>
        <p class="fade-text">When my clone first arrived, I was excited.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I wouldn't need to work or do chores.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">It was strange at first, to watch yourself in third person.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I had to remind myself that he wasn't a person at all.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I tried not to talk to him, and referring to him as "it";</p>
        <p class="fade-text">To remove the semblance of humanity.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">And after a year I grew more accustomed.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">Even began to see it's behavior differ from mine.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">It made me laugh once, which was jarring.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I asked it.. "Do you want to be me?"</p>
        <p class="fade-text">To which it replied, "I am nobody."</p>
        <p class="fade-text">And thus I began assigning more responsibiltiy.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">Call my girlfriend, check on my friends, and for the time it was good.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I'd rid myself of responsibility but I began to question;</p>
        <p class="fade-text">What makes us human?</p>
        <p class="fade-text">Was it our relationships? Our chores? Our thoughts?</p>
        <p class="fade-text">Because as time passed, my relationships began to deteriorate.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">"He's more you than you are."</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I was unable to work.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">And I couldn't put together thoughts because I'd harbored myself from my life.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I started looking at it the way it must've first viewed me.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">As I became a lifeless machine, and he was living my life.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">She loved him. They loved him.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I thought about killing him, but what was that going to do?</p>
        <p class="fade-text">I didn't realise by assigning him my life, that I would be taking on his.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">Be careful what you wish for.</p>
        <p class="fade-text">... The End ...</p>
        <p class="fade-text">Learn from our mistakes. Death is greed.</p>
